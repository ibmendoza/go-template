**Template for Web-based app and microservices**

- Web app - modified https://github.com/create-go-app/fiber-go-template to add [sq](https://github.com/bokwoon95/sq) support, a much better replacement for sqlx

- Microservices - based on [Erik Benoist NSQ consumer in Go](https://product.reverb.com/how-to-write-an-nsq-consumer-in-go-96ed8bde29ef)
